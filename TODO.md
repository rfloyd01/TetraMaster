Ongoing todo list:
- Need to persist user cards in front end memory to prevent multiple calls to backend when refreshing page
- When winning a match, user should get the option to take one of the opponent's cards
- When losing a match, the opponent should steal one of the user's cards and put it into their own hand
- The player should be able to choose what opponent they want to play (should maybe be a separate component before the card choosing component)
