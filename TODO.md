Ongoing todo list:
- Need to persist user cards in front end memory to prevent multiple calls to backend when refreshing page
- Something seems wrong with battle numbers, take a look into this
- When a battle is won, make sure that any original 'capture' cards actually get captured as well as chained cards
- Card chaining should also happen when the attacking card loses a battle, not just when they win
- When winning a match, user should get the option to take one of the opponent's cards
- When losing a match, the opponent should steal one of the user's cards and put it into their own hand
- The player should be able to choose what opponent they want to play (should maybe be a separate component before the card choosing component)
